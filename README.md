## What's this project all about? ðŸ¤”
Welcome to the pokeAPI Project! This project is all about connecting to the pokeAPI to provide information about Pokemon evolutions. Even if you're not a programmer, you can use this project to learn about your favorite Pokemon's evolution chain.


## How does it work? ðŸ’»
We've used some tools to make this project function:

- Node.js: A technology that helps this project run smoothly.
- Express.js: A tool that simplifies building web applications.
- Axios: A tool for making requests to the pokeAPI.
- Jest: A testing tool.
- Supertest: Another testing tool.


## How to Use It ðŸ“„
Using this project is easy! Just follow these steps:

### Step 1: Clone the Project
To get started, you need to download the project to your own computer. Don't worry, it's simple! Here's how:

1. **Open the Terminal** (on macOS) or **Command Prompt** (on Windows). You can search for it in your computer's search bar.
2. **Navigate to a Folder**: This is where you want to save the project. For example, you can navigate to your "Documents" folder by typing:
   ```
   cd Documents
   ```
3. **Clone the Project**: Copy the following line and paste it into the terminal, then press "Enter":
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/Redwan-Ahmed/pokeAPI.git

   ```

### Step 3: Start the Server
