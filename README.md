# Welcome to the pokeAPI Project

## Applicant Information
- **Project:** Home Office - Technical Test
- **Reference:** EAC 303753
- **Applicant:** Redwan Ahmed

## What's this project all about? ðŸ¤”
This project is all about connecting to the pokeAPI. It allows anyone, even if you're not a programmer, to enter the name of a Pokemon. In return, you'll see information about that Pokemon's evolution.

## How does it work? ðŸ’»
We've used some tools to make this project function:

- Node.js: A technology that helps this project run smoothly.
- Express.js: A tool that simplifies building web applications.
- Axios: A tool for making requests to the pokeAPI.
- Jest: A testing tool.
- Supertest: Another testing tool.

## How to Use It ðŸ“„
Here's how you can use this project, step by step:

### Step 1: Install What's Needed
Open your computer's terminal and type in the following command:
```
npm install
```
Or you can use this slightly longer command:
```
npm install express axios jest supertest
```

### Step 2: Start the Server
In the terminal, type:
```
node index.js
```

### Step 3: Check It Out
You have two simple ways to try it:

1. **Using a Tool (like curl or Postman):**
   Send a special request by typing `http://localhost:3000/pokemon/butterfree` into the tool.
   
2. **Using Your Browser:**
   Just type `http://localhost:3000/pokemon/butterfree` into your browser's address bar. You can use any other Pokemon name you're curious about instead of 'butterfree'.

## How to Test the Application ðŸ§ª
